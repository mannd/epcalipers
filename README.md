## Description
EP Calipers is an Apple iOS application that provides
electronic calipers for making measurements on images of ECGs or other
recordings.  Calculations such as mean heart rate and corrected
QT intervals can be performed directly in the app.

[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).  When used with Apple devices via the iTunes App Store, it is subject to the [standard Apple iOS license agreement](http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/AppleStoreApp.pdf).
