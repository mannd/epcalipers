EP Calipers provides electronic calipers to measure intervals on images of electrocardiograms (ECGs) or electrophysiologic recordings.  Often doctors, nurses and medical technicians photograph and send ECGs to each other via email and messaging using smart phones and tablets.  It is difficult and inaccurate to make measurements on these images with mechanical calipers.  EP Calipers can be used to make accurate ECG measurements and do calculations such as determining mean heart rate and corrected QT interval.  Angles such as the beta angle in Brugada syndrome can be measured as well.  Analyze ECG images you photograph or store on your device, as well as PDF files, such as ECGs generated by the AliveCor Kardiaâ„¢ device.
