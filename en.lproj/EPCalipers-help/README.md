EP Calipers HTML Help
=====================


## Description
This repository provides online Help files for [EP Calipers](https://github.com/mannd/epcalipers).   These help files are being implemented for the Apple iOS version of EP Calipers, but the goal is to make them generic enough for the Android version as well.  EP Calipers for iOS is open source, and licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).  When used with Apple devices via the iTunes App Store, it is subject to the [standard Apple iOS license agreement](http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/AppleStoreApp.pdf).

## Translations
We are interested in translating **EP Calipers** into other languages.  This involves two steps.  The `epcalipers_help.org` file needs to be translated.  In addition the strings used in the app need to be translated.  These are contained in a *Google sheets* file that we will share with translators.  If you are interested in providing a translation, please contact me at the email address below.  We are especially interested in Spanish and Chinese translations.  A stipend for translation services is available.

## Acknowledgments
See the [EP Calipers GitHub page](https://github.com/mannd/epcalipers) for full acknowledgments.

French translation by David Mann, Gretchen Mann, Juliet Mann and Jean-Claude Hounou.  Also thanks to Dr. Pierre Taboulet for confirming to me that a cardiologist's caliper is a "Compas" and not an "Étrier!"

Thanks to Victoria Churilina for the Russian translation.
