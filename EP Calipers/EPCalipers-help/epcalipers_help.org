* You're on call, again...
It's 2 AM and the phone rings.  It's a nurse on the cardiac unit.  Mr. Smith is due to get his antiarrhythmic drug (who comes up with these crazy drug schedules?) and his ECG has a borderline prolonged QTc interval, at least according to the computer.  She's not sure if it is safe to give the drug.  The nurse wants to send you the ECG.

You open the ECG on your phone.  You look at the QT interval.  You're not sure about the computer's measurement.  You really should double check it.  You start counting little boxes.  You pull out the (t)rusty old pair of mechanical calipers some drug rep gave you many years ago, back when such largesse was still legal.  You think to yourself: I live in a digital age.  Am I really making measurements on my iPhone with a physical pair of calipers?
* Electronic calipers
*EP Calipers* provides *electronic calipers* for measuring intervals on images of electrocardiograms (ECGs) or electrophysiologic recordings.  In the electrophysiology lab electronic calipers are included as part of the recording system.  *EP Calipers* is intended to provide similar electronic calipers for use on your iPhone or iPad.  The electronic calipers of *EP Calipers* are more accurate, easier to use, and less dangerous than mechanical calipers (they don't have sharp points!).
* What's new?
This new version of EP Calipers contains new angle measurement calipers and a [[Brugadometer]].
* Quick start
When *EP Calipers* starts, a sample ECG and a time caliper are loaded.
Move the caliper around by touching the caliper's cross-bar and
dragging it with your finger.  Expand and contract the caliper by
putting your finger on either vertical bar and dragging.  Pinch and
zoom the underlying ECG image as needed to enlarge or shrink it.  If
the ECG is bigger than your screen, you can drag the image around with
your finger to choose a place to measure.  The remainder of these
instructions will go over how to load ECG images, add and delete
calipers, calibrate the calipers and make advanced measurements like
the corrected QT interval.
* Loading an image
#+CAPTION: *Image* button
[[./img/image_button.png]]

Use the *Image* button at the top left of the screen to show the *Image* menu at the bottom of your screen. 
#+CAPTION: *Image* menu
[[./img/image_menu.png]]

With this menu you can load and adjust an ECG image.  There are several ways to load an ECG image.
** Take a photo of an ECG
[[./img/camera_icon.png]]Touch the *Camera* button to take a photo of an
ECG tracing and load it into the app.  Note that images captured this
way are not saved in the photos collection of the device.  It's best to use this option to make a quick measurement when you don't need to save the image.
** Select a photo from your photos collection
Touch *Select* to chose an image that is already saved on your device in your photos collection (for example, an image file attached to an email that you saved or a photo that your previously took).
** Select a photo or PDF using the *Share* menu from other apps
*EP Calipers* can open image and PDF files regardless of where they are located on your device.  You can directly open email attachments, iCloud, Google Drive, and Dropbox files.  It is also easy to open ECG images directly from the /AliveCor AliveECG™/ app.  The key to opening images in external apps is to use the *Share* button.  It looks like this: [[./img/share_icon.png]]

Depending on the app, this button may appear at the top of the screen, or it may be necessary to do a long press on an image to open the *Share* menu.  Here you can see the *Share* button at the top right of the /AliveECG/ screen:
#+CAPTION: *Share* button at top right
[[./img/aliveecgtop.png]]

Once the *Share* menu is open, one of the options should be *Copy to EP Calipers*.  Selecting this option will open the image in the app.

#+CAPTION: *Copy to EP Calipers* will open the image in *EP Calipers*
[[./img/copy_to_ep_calipers.png]]

If the *Copy to EP Calipers* option does not appear, then try the *Quick Look* button:

#+CAPTION: The *Quick Look* button is at the lower right
[[./img/quicklook.png]]

or the *Open In...* button.  Selecting it should open a window where *Copy to EP Calipers* appears.

#+CAPTION: The *Open In...* button allows the image to be opened in *EP Calipers*
[[./img/openin.png]]

*** Opening email attachments or Dropbox files
For email attachments or Dropbox files, download the attachment or the file (the details depend on the email app you are using.  Then when viewing the attachment or file, tap or long press to make the *Share* button appear.  Select *Share* and then select *Copy to EP Calipers* to open the image or PDF in the app.  

*** /AliveCor/
To view ECGs in the /AliveCor AliveECG/ app, select *Journal*, then *SHARE* for the specific saved ECG you want to view.

#+CAPTION: The AliveECG *SHARE* button uses an envelope icon
[[./img/alive_ecg.png]]

After selecting the *Share* button, select *PDF* from the options that appear.  Then select the *Share* button at the top right of the screen.  Select *Copy to EP Calipers* and you are ready to measure!

** Multiple page PDFs
When PDF files have more than one page, the app will display the first page initially.  You can go to other pages by selecting *Previous* or *Next* in the Image menu.
* Adjusting the image
You can adjust the positioning of the image using pinch-to-zoom gestures and finger scrolling.  Use the *Adjust* menu to rotate or flip your image.  This is useful if the image is rotated or not quite square to the screen.  You can rotate the image by 90° in either direction, or by increments of 1°.  If you select the *More* menu you can fine-tune the image further, rotating it by as little as 0.1° or flipping the image if for some reason it's reversed (flipping ECGs can be a fun pastime in its own right). Return from the *More* menu back to the *Adjust* menu by selecting *Done*.  Using these various options you should be able to straighten the image so it is square to the calipers.  You should recalibrate your calipers after rotating the image.  If you need to go back to the original position and zoom setting use *Reset*.  After adjusting the image select *Done* to return to the main image menu.

* Exiting Image mode
After loading and adjusting the image, you need to exit Image mode so that you can use the calipers.  Select the *Measure* button at the top left of the screen to return to the *EP Calipers* main screen.
#+CAPTION: Use the *Measure* button to exit *Image* mode
[[./img/measure_button.png]]
* Moving calipers
Drag the crossbar of a caliper to move it as a unit.  Drag the left or right bars (or top or bottom in the case of amplitude calipers) to stretch or shrink the calipers.  Note that you cannot pinch both bars at the same time.
#+CAPTION: Single unselected uncalibrated time caliper
[[./img/uncalibrated_caliper.png]]

Angle calipers are moved as a unit by dragging at the apex of just above the apex of the angle.  Dragging either bar of an angle caliper will open or close the angle.
* Making measurements
The interval measured by each caliper is displayed on top of or next to the crossbar of the caliper.  Until the calipers are calibrated, measurements are displayed in arbitrary units (points, roughly equivalent to screen pixels).  Angle calipers show a measurment of the current angle in degrees.
* Adding and deleting calipers
Select *+* to add new calipers.  
#+CAPTION: Main menu
[[./img/main_menu2.png]]

Calipers can be horizontal (time measurements), vertical (amplitude measurements) or angle (measurements in degrees).  Select *Time*, *Amplitude*, or *Angle* to add the type of caliper you want.  Double-tap a caliper to delete it.
#+CAPTION: Add caliper menu
[[./img/add_caliper_menu.png]]
* Selecting a caliper
When more than one caliper is present, it is necessary that one is selected to be the active caliper when calibrating or making calculated measurements.  By default an unselected caliper is blue and a selected caliper is red (You can change these colors if you want).  Single tapping an unselected caliper will select it.  Tap it again (but not too fast, as a double tap deletes the caliper) to unselect it.  As there can be only one selected caliper at a time, selecting a caliper will unselect any other caliper that happens to be selected.  In some cases a caliper will be selected automatically (for example to do calibration) if you have not already selected one.  If you want to select a different caliper, just tap another.
#+CAPTION: Two uncalibrated calipers, a time and amplitude.  The time caliper is selected.
[[./img/selected_caliper.png]]
* Calibration
Select *Cal* or *Calibration*.  Stretch the selected caliper over a known interval (such as 1000 msec for time, or 10 mm for amplitude calipers).  Select *Set*.  In the dialog box, make sure the interval matches what you are measuring.  Enter both the calibration interval and units (e.g. 500 msec, or 1 sec, or 1 mV).  Select *Set* in the dialog box to set the calibration.  Note that time and amplitude calipers need to be calibrated separately.  Once calibrated, calipers will show intervals in the units used to calibrate.  Newly created calipers will use the same calibration.

[[./img/post_calibration.png]]

Angle calipers do not need to be calibrated.  However, after calibration of time and amplitude calipers, angle calipers can be used as a [[Brugadometer]].
* Changing calibration
You can recalibrate at any time.  You can clear all calibration by selecting *Clear* in the calibration toolbar.  Note that calibration is maintained if the device is rotated or the image is zoomed.  Selecting a new image will reset calibration.
* Interval/Rate
Once a time (horizontal) caliper is calibrated, provided you use time units (such as msec or sec) for the calibration, it is possible to toggle between interval measurements (e.g. 600 msec) and heart rate measurements (e.g. 100 bpm) by selecting *Interval/Rate* on iPads (or *I/R* on iPhones).
* Mean rate and interval calculation
Select a calibrated caliper and stretch it over a number of intervals.  Select *Mean Rate* or *MRate* and enter the number of intervals measured.  A dialog box will show the calculated mean heart rate and interval.  This is useful for calculating rates and intervals in irregular rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation.
* QTc calculation
Select *QTc*.  Stretch the selected caliper over one or more RR intervals and select *Measure*.  Enter the number of intervals the caliper is stretched over and select *Continue*.  Then use the same caliper to measure the QT interval.  Select *Measure*.  A dialog box will give the calculated QTc using Bazett's formula.

* Brugadometer
The Brugadometer is a diagnostic tool for Brugada syndrome developed in collaboration with Dr. Adrian Baranchuk and his colleagues at Queen's University Kingston, Ontario, Canada.  It is a tool intended to distinguish between Brugada syndrome pattern ECGs and ECGs with incomplete right bundle branch block.  This tool is under development in EP Calipers and will probably evolve in future updates.  In order to use the Brugadometer, it is necessary to calibrate an amplitude caliper in millimeters (mm) and to calibrate a time caliper preferably in msec or mm.  After doing so, angle calipers will appear to have a triangle at their apex as shown below.  The triangle base will be located 5 mm below the apex of the triangle.  Proper alignment of this triangle with an r' wave in a person with a suspected Brugada ECG will provide measurement of the so-called 𝞫 angle and the triangle base.  ECGs with 𝞫 angle > 58° and/or triangle base > 160 msec (4 mm at standard ECG recording speed of 25 mm/sec) are at increased probability of having a Brugada ECG.  Please see [[http://europace.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/11/1639][this article]] for further information.
* Preferences
Preferences such as caliper colors and default calibration intervals can be selected in the Settings app of your device under *EP Calipers*. You can also change preferences by selecting the *Preferences* or *Prefs* item on the main menu of the app.  After changing the preferences return to the app by selecting the back button at the top left of the Settings screen.  With some preferences it is necessary to close the *EP Calipers* app before they take effect.  Close the app by double pressing the Home button and then swipe the app away in the app switching screen.  Restart the app and the new settings will take effect.
* Issues and limitations
- Because of the limited nature of iOS multitasking, switching between this app and other apps may result in the image being reset to the default ECG image.  This may require reloading the image.  Be certain that the ECG you are measuring is indeed the one you selected and not the default normal ECG!  Future versions of the app will address this issue further.
- Images taken via the *Camera* button in the app are not saved to your photos.  Using the camera in the app is recommended for quick ECG analysis when you don't need to retain an image of the ECG long-term.
- Rotation of the device will not preserve the relation between the ECG image and the calipers. However calibration /is/ preserved with rotation.
- It is highly recommended that calipers be recalibrated if the image (not the device) is rotated.  The app though does not enforce this.
