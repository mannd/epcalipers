* You're on call, again...
It's 2 AM and the phone rings.  It's a nurse on the cardiac unit.  Mr. Smith is due to get his antiarrhythmic drug (who comes up with these crazy drug schedules?) and his ECG has a borderline prolonged QTc interval, at least according to the computer.  She's not sure if it is safe to give the drug.  The nurse wants to text you the ECG.

You open the ECG on your phone.  You look at the QT interval.  You're not sure about the computer's measurement.  You really should double check it.  You start counting little boxes.  You pull out the (t)rusty old pair of mechanical calipers some drug rep gave you many years ago, back when such largesse was still legal.  You think to yourself: I live in a digital age.  Am I really making measurements on my iPhone with a physical pair of calipers?
* Electronic calipers
*EP Calipers* provides *electronic calipers* for measuring intervals on images of electrocardiograms (ECGs) or electrophysiologic recordings.  In the electrophysiology lab electronic calipers are included as part of the recording system.  *EP Calipers* is intended to provide similar electronic calipers for use on your iPhone or iPad.  The electronic calipers of *EP Calipers* are more accurate, easier to use, and less dangerous than mechanical calipers (they don't have sharp points!).
* What's new?
This new version of *EP Calipers* can be used to analyze PDF files, as well as standard image files.  Multi-page PDF files are supported.  Thus the app can be used to read /AliveCor™/ files as well as academic papers in PDF format.
* Quick start
When *EP Calipers* starts, a sample ECG and a time caliper are loaded.
Move the caliper around by touching the caliper's cross-bar and
dragging it with your finger.  Expand and contract the caliper by
putting your finger on either vertical bar and dragging.  Pinch and
zoom the underlying ECG image as needed.  If the ECG is bigger than
your screen, you can drag the image around with your finger to choose
a place to measure.  The remainder of these instructions will go over
how to load ECG images, add and delete calipers, calibrate the
calipers and make advanced measurements like the corrected QT
interval.
* Loading an image
#+CAPTION: *Image* button
[[./img/image_button.png]]

Use the *Image* button at the top left of the screen to show the *Image* menu at the bottom of your screen. 
#+CAPTION: *Image* menu
[[./img/image_menu.png]]

With this menu you can load and adjust an ECG image.  There are several ways to load an ECG image.
** Take a photo of an ECG
[[./img/camera_icon.png]]Touch the *Camera* button to take a photo of an
ECG tracing and load it into the app.  Note that images captured this
way are not saved in the photos collection of the device.  It's best to use this option to make a quick measurement when you don't need to save the image.
** Select a photo from your photos collection
Touch *Select* to chose an image that is already saved on your device in your photos collection (for example, an image file attached to an email that you saved or a photo that your previously took).
** Select a photo or PDF using the *Share* menu from other apps
*EP Calipers* can open image and PDF files regardless of where they are located on your device.  You can directly open email attachments, iCloud, Google Drive, and Dropbox files.  It is also easy to open ECG images directly from the /AliveCor AliveECG™/ app.  The key to opening images in external apps is to use the *Share* button.  It looks like this: [[./img/share_icon.png]]

Depending on the app, this button may appear at the top of the screen, or it may be necessary to do a long press on an image to open the *Share* menu.  Here you can see the *Share* button at the top right of the /AliveECG/ screen:
#+CAPTION: *Share* button at top right
[[./img/aliveecgtop.png]]

Once the *Share* menu is open, one of the options should be *Copy to EP Calipers*.  Selecting this option will open the image in the app.

#+CAPTION: *Copy to EP Calipers* will open the image in *EP Calipers*
[[./img/copy_to_ep_calipers.png]]

If the *Copy to EP Calipers* option does not appear, then try the *Quick Look* button:

#+CAPTION: The *Quick Look* button is at the lower right
[[./img/quicklook.png]]

or in some cases an *Open In...* button appears.  Selecting it should then open a window where *Copy to EP Calipers* appears.

#+CAPTION: The *Open In...* button allows the image to be opened in *EP Calipers*
[[./img/openin.png]]

*** Opening email attachments or Dropbox files
For email attachments or Dropbox files, download the attachment or the file (the details depend on the email app you are using.  Then when viewing the attachment or file, tap or long press to make the *Share* button appear.  Select *Share* and then select *Copy to EP Calipers* to open the image or PDF in the app.  

*** /AliveCor/
To view ECGs in the /AliveCor AliveECG/ app, select *Journal*, then *SHARE* for the specific saved ECG you want to view.

#+CAPTION: The AliveECG *SHARE* button uses an envelope icon
[[./img/alive_ecg.png]]

After selecting the *Share* button, select *PDF* from the options that appear.  Then select the *Share* button at the top right of the screen.  Select *Copy to EP Calipers* and you are ready to measure!

** Multiple page PDFs
When PDF files have more than one page, the app will display the first page initially.  You can go to other pages by selecting *Previous* or *Next* in the Image menu.
* Adjusting the image
You can adjust the positioning of the image using pinch-to-zoom gestures and finger scrolling.  Use the *Adjust* menu to fine-tune your image further.  You can rotate the image by 90° in either direction, or by increments of 1°.  This is particularly useful if the image is rotated or not quite square to the screen.  Use the options presented to straighten the image.  You should recalibrate your calipers after rotating the image.  If you need to go back to the original position use *Reset*.  After adjusting the image select *Done* to return to the main image menu.
#+CAPTION: The *Adjust* menu
[[./img/adjust_menu.png]]
* Exiting Image mode
After loading and adjusting the image, you need to exit Image mode so that you can use the calipers.  Select the *Measure* button at the top left of the screen to return to the *EP Calipers* main screen.
#+CAPTION: Use the *Measure* button to exit *Image* mode
[[./img/measure_button.png]]
* Moving calipers
Drag the crossbar of a caliper to move it as a unit.  Drag the left or right bars (or top or bottom in the case of amplitude calipers) to stretch or shrink the calipers.  Note that you cannot pinch both bars at the same time.

* Making measurements
The interval measured by each caliper is displayed on top of or next to the crossbar of the caliper.  Until the calipers are calibrated, measurements are displayed in arbitrary units (points, roughly equivalent to screen pixels).
* Adding and deleting calipers
Select *+* to add new calipers.  
#+CAPTION: Main menu, prior to calibration
[[./img/main_menu1.png]]

Calipers can be horizontal (time measurements) or vertical (amplitude measurements).  Select *Time* or *Amplitude* to add the type of caliper you want.  Double-tap a caliper to delete it.
#+CAPTION: Add caliper menu
[[./img/add_caliper_menu.png]]
* Selecting a caliper
When more than one caliper is present, it is necessary that one is selected to be the active caliper when calibrating or making calculated measurements.  By default an unselected caliper is blue and a selected caliper is red (You can change these colors if you want).  Single tapping an unselected caliper will select it.  Tap it again (but not too fast, as a double tap deletes the caliper) will unselect it.  As there can be only one selected caliper at a time, selecting a caliper will unselect any other caliper that happens to be selected.  In some cases a caliper will be selected automatically (for example to do calibration) if you have not already selected one.  If you want to select a different caliper, just tap another.

* Calibration
Select *Cal* or *Calibration*.  Stretch the selected caliper over a known interval (such as 1000 msec for time, or 10 mm for amplitude calipers).  Select *Set*.  In the dialog box, make sure the interval matches what you are measuring.  Enter both the calibration interval and units (e.g. 500 msec, or 1 sec, or 1 mV).  Select *Set* in the dialog box to set the calibration.  Note that time and amplitude calipers need to be calibrated separately.  Once calibrated, calipers will show intervals in the units used to calibrate.  Newly created calipers will use the same calibration.

* Changing calibration
You can recalibrate at any time.  You can clear all calibration by selecting *Clear* in the calibration toolbar.  Note that calibration is maintained if the device is rotated or the image is zoomed.  Selecting a new image will reset calibration.
* Interval/Rate
Once a time (horizontal) caliper is calibrated, provided you use time units (such as msec or sec) for the calibration, it is possible to toggle between interval measurements (e.g. 600 msec) and heart rate measurements (e.g. 100 bpm) by selecting *Interval/Rate* on iPads (or *I/R* on iPhones).
* Mean rate and interval calculation
Select a calibrated caliper and stretch it over a number of intervals.  Select *Mean Rate* or *MRate* and enter the number of intervals measured.  A dialog box will show the calculated mean heart rate and interval.  This is useful for calculating rates and intervals in irregular rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation.
* QTc calculation
Select *QTc*.  Stretch the selected caliper over one or more RR intervals and select *Measure*.  Enter the number of intervals the caliper is stretched over and select *Calculate*.  Then use the same caliper to measure the QT interval.  Select *Measure*.  A dialog box will give the calculated QTc using Bazett's formula.

* Settings
Preferences such as caliper colors and default calibration intervals can be selected in the Settings app of your device under *EP Calipers*.  Note that by the nature of iOS it is necessary to close the *EP Calipers* app before new settings take effect.  Close the app by double pressing the Home button and then swipe the app away in the app switching screen.  Restart the app and the new settings will take effect.
* Issues
Because of the limited nature of iOS multitasking, switching between this app and other apps may result in the image being reset to the default ECG image.  This may require reloading the image.  Note also that images taken via the *Camera* button in the app are not saved to your photos.  Using the camera in the app is recommended for quick ECG analysis when you don't need to retain an image of the ECG long-term.
