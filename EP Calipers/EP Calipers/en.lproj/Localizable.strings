Expand and contract the caliper by putting your finger on either vertical bar and dragging.  Pinch and zoom the underlying ECG image as needed to enlarge or shrink it.  If the ECG is bigger than your screen, you can drag the image around with your finger to choose a place to measure.  Calibrate a caliper to make measurements.";

After selecting the *Share* button, select *PDF* from the options that appear.  Then select the *Share* button at the top right of the screen.\n\n- Adjusting the image\n\nYou can adjust the positioning of the image using pinch-to-zoom gestures and finger scrolling.  Long press on the image to bring up a menu that allows you to rotate the image and change pages if you have loaded a PDF.\n\n- Lock the image in place\n\nWhen moving and adjusting calipers, you may sometimes inadvertently move the underlying image.  Select *Lock* to lock the image in place.  A message appears at the top of the screen indicating the image is locked.  Unlock the image by selecting *Unlock*.";

"Move_caliper_text" = "Drag the crossbar of a caliper to move it as a unit.  Drag the left or right bars (or top or bottom in the case of amplitude calipers) to stretch or shrink the calipers.  Angle calipers are moved as a unit by dragging at the apex or just above the apex of the angle.  Dragging either bar of an angle caliper a little distance away from the apex will open or close the angle.";

By default an unselected caliper is blue and a selected caliper is red.  Single tapping an unselected caliper will select it.  Tap it again (but not too fast, as a double tap deletes the caliper) to unselect it.";

Then long press a caliper component (crossbar, sidebar, or, in case of an angle caliper, the apex of the angle) and a menu with movement buttons will appear.  Buttons with left and right or up and down arrows move the selected caliper component or the whole caliper using micromovements.  You can move either sidebar (or either angle of an angle caliper) or a caliper as a whole by gradations of a single point (≈ pixel) or a tenth of a point, depending on which type of arrow you press (⇨ or →).  Press the *Done* button to return to the main menu.\n- Marching calipers\nLong press a caliper and* select *March* to convert a time caliper to a marching caliper.  Vertical caliper lines will appear equal to the caliper width on either side of the caliper.  This is very useful to assess the regularity or irregularity of a rhythm, or to detect P waves marching through a tachycardia or during heart block.  Select *March* again to change the marching caliper back to normal again.";
